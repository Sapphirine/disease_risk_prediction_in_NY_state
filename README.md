* Our study seeks to identify the likelihood of having a disease and thus improve the public health through disease risk management. 
* By incorporating machine learning techniques, we are able to predict most possible diseases for a given individual. The prediction can benefit many diverse users, including individual patients, health care organizations, insurance companies and policymakers. 
* Ultimately, we hope disease prediction can be widely used to address issues of public health and safety as well as create a better and healthier community.
